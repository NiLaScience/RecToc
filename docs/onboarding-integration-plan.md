# Interview Feature Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the real-time interview workflow from openai-realtime-agents into our application.

## 1. Dependencies Setup
- [ ] Copy required dependencies from openai-realtime-agents to our package.json
  - OpenAI SDK
  - Audio processing libraries
  - Agent framework dependencies

## 2. Agent Configuration Integration
- [ ] Create new directory `src/agents/interview`
- [ ] Copy and adapt the interview workflow:
  - [ ] `initialInterviewer.ts` - Main interviewer agent
  - [ ] `careerAdvisor.ts` - Career guidance agent
  - [ ] `tools.ts` - CV reading and processing tools
  - [ ] Modify CV reading tool to work with our Firebase structure

## 3. Firebase Integration
- [ ] Add new collection for interview sessions
- [ ] Create CV data structure matching `sampleCV.json` format
- [ ] Add Firebase security rules for interview data access
- [ ] Create service functions in `src/services/interview.ts`:
  - [ ] `startInterviewSession`
  - [ ] `saveInterviewResults`
  - [ ] `getInterviewHistory`

## 4. UI Components
- [ ] Create new modal component `src/components/InterviewModal.tsx`:
  - [ ] Interview status display
  - [ ] Audio recording controls
  - [ ] Real-time transcript display
  - [ ] Progress indicator
  - [ ] Results summary view
- [ ] Add interview button to Profile page
- [ ] Create interview results view component

## 5. Audio Processing
- [ ] Set up audio recording and streaming
- [ ] Implement real-time transcription
- [ ] Add audio playback for agent responses
- [ ] Handle audio permissions

## 6. State Management
- [ ] Create interview state slice
- [ ] Add actions for:
  - [ ] Starting/ending interview
  - [ ] Managing audio state
  - [ ] Updating transcript
  - [ ] Storing results

## 7. Error Handling & UX
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Error boundaries for agent failures
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Audio device error handling
- [ ] Progress saving/recovery

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for interview agents
- [ ] Integration tests for Firebase operations
- [ ] UI component tests
- [ ] End-to-end interview flow test

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Add setup instructions
- [ ] Document interview flow
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update API documentation

## Implementation Notes

- The interview feature will be integrated as a modal component in the profile page
- CV data will be fetched from Firebase before starting the interview
- Real-time audio processing will be handled using the same approach as the original openai-realtime-agents implementation
- All interview sessions and results will be stored in Firebase for future reference

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, we recommend starting with either:
1. Firebase integration to set up the data structure
2. Basic modal UI component to establish the foundation for the interview interface

Choose based on team capacity and current sprint priorities.
