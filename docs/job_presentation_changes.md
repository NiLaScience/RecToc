Below is an **implementation plan** for refactoring the existing app from video-centric job posts toward **slide-based** job posts (with optional videos). The plan focuses on **architectural changes** and **key technical details**—not on testing or final implementation. The goal is to reuse as much of the existing infrastructure as possible while preserving feed behavior, user interaction (grid vs. fullscreen, swiping), and optional video uploads.

---

## 1. Data Structure and Firebase Changes

### 1.1 `JobOpening` Firestore Schema

Currently, each `JobOpening` document has fields like:
```ts
export interface JobOpening {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  videoUrl: string;
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
  jobDescription?: JobDescription; // from the parser
  tags: string[];
  userId: string;
  createdAt: string;
  views: number;
  likes: number;
  transcript?: Transcript | null;
  // ...
}
```

**Planned Modifications**:
1. **Make video optional**:
   - Convert `videoUrl` to an optional field, e.g. `videoUrl?: string`.
   - Remove or deprecate `thumbnailUrl`; it is no longer required for slides, but we may keep it if a user **does** choose to upload a video (as before).
2. **Add TTS voiceover support**:
   - Add optional field `voiceoverUrl?: string` if we want to store the TTS audio after generating it.  
   - Or, store one voiceover URL per slide if each slide has distinct audio.
3. **Introduce `slides` array** to store 4 slides:
   ```ts
   // Each element is a "slide" object created via the LLM prompt
   interface Slide {
     title: string;        // e.g. "Highlights"
     heading: string;      // Short tagline
     bullets: string[];    // Bullet points for the slide
     backgroundImageUrl?: string;  // DALLE or other AI-generated image
   }
   ```
   - Then `JobOpening` will have `slides?: Slide[];`
4. **Keep `jobDescription`** (already used to store the parsed PDF's content).  
   - This object is fed to the LLM to generate the `slides`.
5. **Maintain existing fields** like `tags`, `userId`, `createdAt`, etc.

**High-Level Schema:**
```ts
// Old fields remain; below are new/modified relevant parts:
export interface JobOpening {
  ...
  // New or updated
  slides?: Slide[]; 
  videoUrl?: string; // optional
  voiceoverUrl?: string; // optional or per-slide approach

  // Possibly remove or deprecate:
  // thumbnailUrl?: string; // only used if user uploaded a video
}
```

### 1.2 New Cloud Function or LLM Endpoint for Slide Generation
We already have `callGeminiAPI` or `callOpenAIAPI` function calls. We can add a specialized function:

- `generateSlidesFromDescription`: Takes the relevant `JobDescription` structure, returns an array of 4 `Slide` objects with `title`, `heading`, `bullets`, plus any AI-generated background images.  
- For images, we can reuse `callOpenAIAPI` with DALL·E or similar. Each slide background is stored in Firebase Storage.

This might be part of the existing `ParserService.ts` or a new service class, e.g. `SlideGenerationService.ts`.

---

## 2. Generating and Storing Slides

### 2.1 Slide Creation Flow (Upload or Edit Job)
1. **User provides** (or must provide) PDF-based job description.  
2. We parse it using the existing parser (`ParserService.parseJobDescription`).
3. **Call LLM** with the resulting `JobDescription` to produce a 4-slide JSON definition:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "title": "Highlights",
       "heading": "Key perks at ACME Inc.",
       "bullets": ["...", "..."],
       "backgroundImageUrl": "...dalle-generated-link..."
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```
4. **Store slides** in `JobOpening.slides`.
5. (Optional) If TTS voiceover is requested, we generate an audio file (via `SpeechSynthesis` or an OpenAI audio endpoint) and store that URL in `JobOpening.voiceoverUrl` or as part of each slide if per-slide audio is needed.

### 2.2 Voiceover
- If the user wants text-to-speech, we can store the resulting `.mp3` or `.wav` file in Firebase Storage and reference it from `voiceoverUrl`.
- Alternatively, we store 4 separate voiceovers inside each `Slide` object if we want granular voiceover per slide.

---

## 3. UI / UX Changes

### 3.1 Feed Component Changes

Currently, **Feed** displays each job's video in either **grid view** or **fullscreen**. We will adapt:

1. **Grid View**:  
   - Instead of a thumbnail from `video.thumbnailUrl`, we show the highlight slide's `backgroundImageUrl` (i.e., `slides[0].backgroundImageUrl`) or a placeholder if no image is generated.  
   - Overlaid text from the highlight slide (or any chosen "main" slide): show `slides[0].heading` or `slides[0].title`.
   - If a job has an optional `videoUrl`, place a **"Play Video"** icon on the tile. Otherwise, hide it.

2. **Fullscreen Swiping**:
   - Up/Down: Same logic (move between jobs).
   - Left/Right: 
     - **If** we are "navigating slides," a left/right tap inside the job allows switching among the 4 slides.  
     - **If** we are in the "swipe to reject or see details" gesture (like the old logic), we still preserve that. We might unify it as:
       - Single-tap left/right on the screen to flip slides **within** a job. 
       - A left-swipe gesture (drag) triggers "reject job," while a right-swipe gesture triggers "open details" or vice versa. We may need logic to differentiate the short tap for slides vs. "drag" for job-level actions.
   - Show the TTS audio playback. If `voiceoverUrl` is present, the existing Mute/Unmute button toggles the TTS audio.  
   - Instead of real-time subtitles, we can either display the bullet points of the current slide as "subtitles," or if we store a TTS transcript, show that.

### 3.2 `VideoPlayer` → **SlideShowPlayer**

We keep optional video. But if no video is set, we do not show the `videoRef`. Instead, we display a new UI:
- `SlideShowPlayer` with 4 slides:
  ```tsx
  interface SlideShowPlayerProps {
    slides: Slide[];
    voiceoverUrl?: string;
    // OnSwipe, OnSlideChange, ...
  }
  ```
- If `videoUrl` is available and the user clicks "Play Video," we can open a small video overlay (the old `VideoPlayer`) or a separate route.  

### 3.3 `JobDetails` Changes

- Remove the assumption that "job details" revolve around a single video. 
- Possibly display the entire 4 slides in a small carousel, plus the detailed `jobDescription` if needed.  
- The user can also see a "Play Video" button if `videoUrl` is set.

---

## 4. Upload Workflow Changes

### 4.1 `Upload.tsx`:

Existing logic:
- The user must fill `title`, choose or record `video`, parse PDF for `jobDescription`, etc.

**New Requirements**:
1. **Job Description** is mandatory:
   - The user must provide a PDF or text-based job description, which we parse and store.
2. **Slides Generation**:
   - After or alongside the parse, we must automatically call the LLM to generate the 4 slides. Possibly show a "Generate Slides" button or do it automatically once the parse is complete.
3. **Video Upload** is optional:
   - If the user wants a video, the existing code remains, but does not require a thumbnail if no video is present.
4. **Voiceover** generation (TTS) is optional:
   - Replace the "Transcribe Video" step with "Generate Voiceover" if the user wants slides read aloud.
   - `voiceoverUrl` or `slide[i].voiceoverUrl` is generated from the 4 slides' bullet points, or a concatenated script.

**Data**:
- The final `JobOpening` is posted with `slides` required (from LLM), `videoUrl` optional, `voiceoverUrl` optional.

---

## 5. New Services and Functions

1. **`SlideGenerationService`** (or `ParserService` extension):
   - `generateSlides(jobDescription: JobDescription): Promise<Slide[]>`
   - Internally calls the LLM or a custom "generateSlides" function in Cloud Functions.
   - For each slide, also calls the image-generation endpoint (e.g. DALL·E) to get `backgroundImageUrl`.
2. **TTS generation** (if used server-side):
   - Possibly a new function: `generateVoiceoverFromSlides(slides: Slide[])`. 
   - We can store a single combined audio track or separate per slide.  

---

## 6. Maintaining Swiping / Navigation

The existing feed and fullscreen logic rely on `VideoPlayer`. We can modify or create a new shared component:

- **`JobViewer`** (unified):
  - If `job.videoUrl` → show a "Play Video" button that, when clicked, opens `VideoPlayer`.
  - Otherwise, default to a "SlideShowPlayer" that cycles among the `slides`.
  - Keep the same up/down gestures for job switching, left/right gestures for reject or "details."  
  - Single taps inside the job might move between slides if we're not in "drag swipe" mode.

We must carefully unify these so that short taps vs. swipes are properly handled.  

---

## 7. Potential Side Effects & Considerations

1. **Migration**: 
   - Old `JobOpening` docs that only have `videoUrl` can remain valid. They simply have no `slides`. We display them in the old manner or fallback to no slides.  
2. **Performance**: 
   - Generating images via DALL·E for each new job might require caching or async generation. If needed, we store placeholders or do the generation offline.  
3. **User Experience**:
   - Must ensure that swiping for slides vs. swiping for job rejections does not conflict. Possibly restrict "slides left/right" to small left/right taps, while "drag left/right" reverts to job-level logic.  
4. **Audio**:
   - Mute/unmute now toggles TTS playback. If there is also a user-supplied video, we keep two distinct audio players (or unify them with separate controls).  

---

## 8. Summary of Required File Modifications

Below is a list of where changes might be made (not full code, but location references and rationale):

1. **`src/types/job_opening.ts`**  
   - Add `slides?: Slide[]` and remove mandatory `videoUrl`.  
   - Possibly remove `thumbnailUrl` or mark optional.  

2. **`src/components/Feed.tsx`** and **`src/components/VideoTile.tsx`**  
   - In grid mode, retrieve `slides[0].backgroundImageUrl` (fallback if missing) instead of `thumbnailUrl`.  
   - If `videoUrl` exists, show a small "play video" icon or overlay.  

3. **`src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`** (or replace with `SlideShowPlayer.tsx`)  
   - Introduce a new "slide-based" player.  
   - Possibly rename or separate logic so that the feed references a new component for slides, while legacy references remain for optional video.  

4. **`src/app/page.tsx`** or any feed loading logic  
   - Make sure to handle jobs that have or do not have the new `slides`.  

5. **`src/components/Upload.tsx`**  
   - Make job description field mandatory.  
   - On parse success, call new function to generate the 4 slides.  
   - Make video optional. If user chooses to generate TTS, call new function to create or store `voiceoverUrl`.  
   - No subtitle generation step—remove or rename this button.  

6. **`ParserService`** or new **`SlideGenerationService`**  
   - A method `generateSlides(jobDesc: JobDescription): Promise<Slide[]>` calls the LLM with a custom prompt to produce four slides.  
   - Another method for DALLE or image generation.  
   - Possibly a method to generate TTS from the bullet points.  

7. **Firebase side**:  
   - No big schema migration is needed. We can store additional fields in `job_openings`.  
   - New or updated rules to allow storing `slides` and an optional `voiceoverUrl` in each job.  

---

## 9. Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Single TTS Track**: Each job will have a single combined TTS audio track (`voiceoverUrl`) that plays through all slides sequentially. This simplifies audio management and provides a more cohesive narrative experience.

2. **Navigation Controls**:
   - **Tapping**: Left/right taps on the screen will navigate between slides within a job
   - **Swiping**: Full swipe gestures are reserved exclusively for job-level actions:
     - Swipe right: Open job details
     - Swipe left: Reject/skip job
   This clear separation between taps and swipes eliminates gesture confusion.

3. **Asynchronous Image Generation**: 
   - Job creation will proceed immediately after slide content generation
   - Background images will be generated asynchronously
   - Jobs will display with placeholder backgrounds until DALL·E images are ready
   - The `JobOpening` document will be updated with `backgroundImageUrl` fields as images complete
   This approach optimizes for faster job posting while maintaining visual richness.

4. **Clean Slate Data Approach**:
   - No migration of old video-only jobs
   - Fresh start with the new slides-based format
   - All new jobs must conform to the new schema with required slides
   - Legacy video-only data will be archived or deleted
   This ensures a consistent, modern experience across all job posts.

---

### Implementation Impact

These decisions affect the implementation in the following ways:

1. **Audio Implementation**:
   - Remove per-slide voiceover fields from the `Slide` interface
   - Implement a single audio player component that tracks slide transitions
   - TTS generation will process all slide content at once

2. **UI Controls**:
   - Implement clear touch event differentiation between taps and swipes
   - Add visual indicators for slide navigation (e.g., dots or progress bar)
   - Remove any legacy swipe-to-preview features

3. **Image Pipeline**:
   - Implement a background job queue for DALL·E image generation
   - Add placeholder images and loading states
   - Create an update mechanism for when images complete

4. **Data Cleanup**:
   - Create a cleanup script for legacy data
   - Update validation rules to enforce new schema
   - Remove legacy video-only code paths

These architectural decisions prioritize user experience clarity and technical simplicity while enabling a clean break from the legacy video-centric implementation.

---

### Final Note
All existing code for **authentication**, **FireStore watchers**, and **UI context** remains relevant. The biggest shift is introducing a **Slides concept** for each job, optionally supplemented by a user's uploaded video, plus optional TTS. Most code that references the old `thumbnailUrl` or `transcript` would be updated to reference the new `slides` array or the optional `videoUrl` if provided.  

This plan keeps the rest of the system changes **minimally invasive**, ensuring the feed, swiping, and optional video remain intact.
